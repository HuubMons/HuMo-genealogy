"Automatic merging is a dangerous business. Therefore many clauses are used "
"to make sure the persons are indeed identical. Besides identical names, "
"identical birth or death dates and identical names of parents, also the "
"parents' wedding date is included. If you consider this too much and rely on "
"the above clauses, you can disable this."
